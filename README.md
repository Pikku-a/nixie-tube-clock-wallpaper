# Nixie tube clock live wallpaper
- Inspired by the divergence meter in Steins;Gate
- Written in c++ for good performance (not sure if the performance can be called good though)
- Made for Linux (gnome only) - Windows stuff is commented, so uncommenting and editing it a little you could make it work on Windows

There are some bugs that I am aware of, but too lazy to fix them. If you use this and feel like fixing them, you are welcome to do so.

The images are not mine, I got them from here: https://github.com/MKSanic/divergence-meter


## How to use it

1. Run it
Right click the file named nixie-clock and select "execute".
Or open the terminal in the folder of the program and write ./nixie-clock
You might need to right click, select "Properties", go to "Permissions" tab and enable "Allow executing file as program"

2. Set it as a Startup app
Open Startup Applications Preferences app.
