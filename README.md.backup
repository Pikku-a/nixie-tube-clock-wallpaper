# Nixie tube clock live wallpaper
- Inspired by the divergence meter in Steins;Gate
- Written in c++ for good performance
- Made for Linux (gnome) - Windows stuff is commented, so uncommenting and editing it a little you could make it work on Windows

There are some bugs that I am aware of, but too lazy to fix them. If you use this and feel like fixing them, you are welcome to do so. 

The images are not mine, I got them from here: https://github.com/MKSanic/divergence-meter
